# RockPaperScissor-OdinP3


lets make the plan how i am going to proceed for the rock paper scissor.

Algorithm.

the game will be played between the couputer and the player.

1. create a arry that holds rock, paper and scissor.
2. create a function called "Random" that generate a random index between 0 to 3.
3. Use random as the index of the array.
4. create another funcion called getComputerChoice that return either rock , paper or scissor.
5. write function called playRound that playes a single round of the game. the function should take two parameter as playerSelection and computerSelection.
6. write a function called that calls playRound 5 times in a loop. so that the games runs fine time before declaring the winner.
